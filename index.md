He would now like to put a controller, which shows some temperatures, controls a few valves here and there. And suddenly, he can't. He built the system, he knows how it works, and he knows how it should work. And he's blocked by the easiest part of the whole project.

Because he's not a programmer. Also, he's 70 years old, so learning new programming languages is not really for him anymore. Lucky him, he's got a son who happens to be a programmer.
