# The Tevukas story

We all know at least one Tevukas (a.k.a. Dad), which are engineers and can construct many fantastic things with their hands. Like, for example, a lawn sprinkler system.

He would now like to put a controller, which shows some temperatures, controls a few valves here and there. And suddenly, he can't. He built the system, he knows how it works, and he knows how it should work. And he's blocked by the easiest part of the whole project.

Why?

Because he's not a programmer. Also, he's 70 years old, so learning new programming languages is not really for him anymore. Lucky him, he's got a son who happens to be a programmer.

Surely, those couple of buttons and labels cannot be that hard?.. Unfortunately, they are.

# Commercial users, too

Not every business is big enough to have their own software division. Often just a few buttons can make a huge impact in productivity.

# Where are we now?
We do have a few bits and pieces working already.

## Visual programming
In visual programming, Tevukas does not have to fight the syntax war. He can concentrate on the problem he is solving.

## Dashboards
You can have none, you can have many. Dashboards are aren't mandatory.

## Historical data

Yeah, we've got that, too.
